# HARAMBE E DAO — PRD

**Project:** Harambee DAO — AI-Audited, Multi-Sig Community Treasury
**One-line:** Stop embezzlement in community savings groups by releasing funds only after verifiable, AI-verified project milestones — and let members vote via SMS.

---

## 1 — Problem statement (short)

Informal community savings groups (chamas / ROSCAs) manage large pools of social capital but suffer governance failures and theft/embezzlement (studies show meaningful governance risk and reported theft/embezzlement rates in community groups). These failures cost communities, erode trust, and block capital flows into productive activities. ([FSD Africa Archive][1], [Money254][2])

**User-provided impact claim:** “chamas lose \$3B/year” — treat as a project assumption / business-model input to be validated in-country during the pilot (we’ll instrument the pilot to measure real losses and recovery).

---

## 2 — Vision

A low-cost, auditable, and community-friendly **DAO** that secures pooled savings with:

* **AI Auditor** (computer-vision + complementary sensors) to verify off-chain project milestones (e.g., satellite imagery confirms crop planting),
* **Multi-sig Treasury** (Gnosis Safe) that enforces payment rules and timelocks,
* **SMS governance UX** so every member (even feature-phone users) can vote, and
* **Low-cost DA anchoring** so proofs and evidence are cheaply and immutably available. ([Safe Docs][3], [Celestia Docs][4])

---

## 3 — Goals & measurable success metrics

Primary goals:

* Pilot in 3 communities → **Reduce embezzlement incidence** in pilot groups by ≥70% vs baseline.
* Recoverable funds transparency (on-chain audit trail) for 100% of disbursements.
* Fast, accessible governance: **>80% vote response** rate via SMS on pilot proposals.
* AI audit accuracy: **≥95% precision** on “milestone satisfied” vs field verification.

KPIs:

* Number of groups onboarded, monthly active voters, transaction volume, false positive/negative audit rate, average time from audit to disbursement, and compliance incidents.

---

## 4 — Target users & stakeholders

* Primary: community savings groups (Chamas/ROSCAs), group treasurers, smallholder farmer collectives.
* Secondary: local NGOs, microfinance institutions (MFIs), community leaders, telco partners (SMS providers), and auditors/regulators.
* Stakeholders to engage early: community leaders, local regulators, telcos, and a local NGO for pilot logistics.

---

## 5 — Solution overview & core flows

High level:

1. Group registers and deposits funds into a **multi-sig Gnosis Safe** treasury controlled by member signers (onboarding can be hybrid: on-chain multisig keys for power users and delegated signers with custodial keys for non-crypto users). ([Safe Docs][3])
2. Project milestone defined and posted (e.g., “Planting complete on Plot A by 2025-09-20”). The proposal is distributed to members (SMS + web app).
3. **AI Auditor** pulls satellite / drone imagery (and optionally field photos) and runs a CV pipeline (ResNet-50 backbone → classifier/segmentation / NDVI delta) to determine whether milestone is satisfied. Evidence (annotated images, model output) is hashed, stored off-chain (IPFS/Filecoin) and the hash anchored on-chain (Celestia or chosen L1). ([arXiv][5], [Planet][6], [docs.filecoin.io][7])
4. Oracle network (e.g., Chainlink or specialist AI oracle) verifies the signed evidence and calls the Gnosis Safe to create an execution TX — either requiring multi-sig approvals or, if quorum met automatically, directly releasing funds. ([Chainlink Blog][8], [Chainlink][9])
5. Members vote via SMS (YES/NO#) or in the web UI. SMS votes are normalized, verified against membership list, and included in the on-chain approval flow (twice-signed attestation or stored as hashes). Twilio handles messaging integration and webhooks. ([Twilio][10])

---

## 6 — Tech stack (recommended)

* **Multi-sig treasury:** Gnosis Safe (Safe Apps integration for governance UI / transaction service). ([Safe Docs][3])
* **Data availability / anchoring:** Celestia DA (post evidence roots to Celestia to keep posting costs low) or anchor evidence to an L1 while storing bulk evidence off-chain. ([Celestia Docs][4])
* **Off-chain storage & immutability:** IPFS + Filecoin (encrypt PII, store image evidence and metadata; put CID on-chain). ([docs.filecoin.io][7])
* **AI / CV:** ResNet-50 backbone + segmentation/classifier heads (transfer learning on satellite/drone imagery); NDVI/time-series change detection for crop progress. ([arXiv][5], [EOS Data Analytics][11])
* **Oracles & Attestation:** Chainlink Functions / AI-oracle pattern or specialist AI-oracle (aggregate model outputs, sign attestation). ([Chainlink Blog][8], [Chainlink][9])
* **Messaging / Governance UX:** Twilio (SMS & WhatsApp APIs + webhooks) for SMS voting, fallback to USSD if needed. ([Twilio][10])
* **Backend & infra:** Kubernetes, Postgres (ledger & membership), Redis (queues), S3 for ephemeral storage of uploads, HSMs for key management.
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry, on-chain watchers.

## 7 — Functional requirements (summary)

1. **Group onboarding** (phone number, membership roster, KYC minimal / e-consent).
2. **Treasury setup** (Gnosis Safe deployed per group, group signers + recovery rules). ([Safe Docs][3])
3. **Proposal posting** (web UI + SMS broadcast; proposal metadata schema and deadline).
4. **AI Audit pipeline** (ingest imagery, run CV model, generate evidence, compute confidence & ROI metrics). ([arXiv][5], [Planet][6])
5. **Attestation & anchoring** (IPFS store → post hash to Celestia/L1 → oracle reads anchor and produces signed attestation). ([docs.filecoin.io][7], [Celestia Docs][4])
6. **Governance & vote counting** (SMS inbound webhook, verify sender → map to member → tally & produce signed vote statement). ([Twilio][10])
7. **Fund disbursement** (Gnosis Safe executes payment when vote + attestation conditions satisfied). ([Safe Docs][3])

---

## 8 — Non-functional requirements

* Availability: 99.9% for web/messaging services (on-chain availability relies on chosen L1/DA).
* Latency: Audit → attestation → payment window target **< 12 hours** for remote projects (shorter for local drone imagery).
* Security: HSM for private keys, encrypted storage of images, hashed+salted member mapping, rate limits on SMS votes to avoid spam.
* Privacy: PII never stored on public chain; only hashes/CIDs + zero-knowledge attestation metadata (if required).

---

## 9 — AI Auditor design (technical)

**Objective:** verify “project milestone satisfied” (binary or graded) from imagery and sensor data.

**Inputs**

* Satellite imagery (Planet, Sentinel) for relevant parcel dates, drone or mobile photos where available, NDVI time series, geofence polygon, project metadata (planting date, crop type). ([Planet][6], [EOS Data Analytics][11])

**Architecture**

* **Preprocessing:** orthorectify, cloud mask, align time series, compute NDVI / EVI deltas.
* **Backbone:** ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on satellite crop dataset. For segmentation tasks use a U-Net / DeepLabv3 with ResNet-50 encoder to localize planted rows or canopy cover. ([arXiv][5])
* **Head(s):**

  * Classifier: milestone\_passed (bool) + confidence\_score.
  * Regression: percent\_crop\_cover\_estimate.
  * Explainability: Grad-CAM heatmaps for human auditors.
* **Postprocessing:** combine CV outputs with NDVI delta thresholds and temporal consistency checks → final decision and confidence.
* **Output:** JSON evidence bundle `{ decision, confidence, CID (IPFS), model_version, hash }` with attached annotated images for human review.

**Model lifecycle**

* Train with regional datasets + synthetic augmentations (cloud cover, lighting).
* Continual learning loop: field validation labels from pilot used to retrain quarterly.
* Model signing & provenance: store model hash and metadata on-chain/off-chain (attestation) so oracle outputs can be auditable. ([containers.github.io][12])

## 10 — Oracle & attestation pattern

1. **AI runs offline** and produces an evidence bundle + IPFS CID.
2. **Oracle node (or DON)** fetches CID, verifies the bundle, runs lightweight consensus (e.g., 3 independent model runs or independent oracle verifiers) and **returns a signed attestation** to a smart contract. Use Chainlink or a specialist AI oracle for decentralized attestation. ([Chainlink Blog][8], [Chainlink][9])
3. **Smart contract** verifies attestation signature(s) and then triggers Safe TX creation (or signals the Safe app to create the TX that signers will approve). The Safe Transaction Service API can be used to create and track Safe transactions. ([Safe Docs][3])
4. **Evidence anchoring:** anchor the CID + attestation root to Celestia DA (cheaper for large datasets) or to your chosen L1 if you prefer that settlement. ([Celestia Docs][4])

---

## 11 — Governance UX (SMS + Web)

* **SMS proposal flow:** Admin posts proposal → system sends SMS with unique short code + reply options (YES/NO#) → Twilio webhook receives replies → backend verifies phone number in membership roster and records vote. Twilio Tutorials & Programmable Messaging are straightforward for this integration. ([Twilio][10])
* **Anti-spam / security:** OTP confirmation for first-time voters or per-proposal challenge when suspicious activity detected.
* **Audit trail:** store votes as signed hashes (store on IPFS + anchor hash on DA for tamper-proof audit).

---

## 12 — Step-by-step implementation plan (detailed timeline)

### Phase 0 — Setup & stakeholder engagement 

* Engage community leaders, local NGO partner, and telco SMS provider; sign MOUs.
* Register legal entities or sandbox approvals; define KYC/minimum compliance (local rules vary).
* Set success criteria and pilot KPIs; choose 3 pilot communities.

### Phase 1 — Minimal infra & treasury

* Build membership backend (Postgres) and onboarding UI.
* Deploy Gnosis Safe per group (generate signer keys, recovery). Test Safe apps integration. ([Safe Docs][3])
* Implement basic SMS broadcast and inbound webhook via Twilio sandbox. ([Twilio][10])

### Phase 2 — AI Auditor prototype

* Collect training imagery (local + public datasets).
* Implement preprocessing & build ResNet-50 fine-tune + segmentation proof-of-concept. ([arXiv][5], [Planet][6])
* Produce evidence bundle format + IPFS storage flow.

### Phase 3 — Oracle & attestation pipeline 

* Implement oracle adapter (Chainlink Functions or custom DON) that pulls evidence from IPFS, verifies model output, and signs attestation. ([Chainlink][9])
* Integrate oracle attestation with Safe transaction creation flow.

### Phase 4 — Governance, rules & wallet UX 

* Implement SMS voting rules, OTP, vote tally, and vote attestation anchoring.
* Implement Safe App / dashboard showing proposals, attestation, and pending Safe TXs.

### Phase 5 — Security, pilot launch & validation 

* Third-party smart-contract audit, security pentest, AI robustness & anti-spoof testing.
* Launch pilot with 3 communities: run 6 month pilot, conduct ground truth field checks for each audited milestone to measure model precision and human overlap.

### Phase 6 — Iterate & scale (Post-pilot)

* Expand to more groups, add drone imagery pipeline where feasible, and build fraud-analytics for anomalous patterns.

## 13 — Example API contracts (templates)

**1) Twilio inbound SMS webhook**
`POST /webhooks/sms`
Body (form-encoded): `From=+2547xxxx&Body=YES1&MessageSid=SM...`
Response: `200 OK` (ack) — server reads From, parses vote, maps to memberId, stores signed vote record `{memberId, proposalId, vote, timestamp}` and pushes hash to IPFS.

**2) AI audit result webhook (from auditor/oracle)**
`POST /webhooks/audit-result`

```json
{
  "proposalId":"prop-123",
  "decision": "PASS",
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "evidenceCID": "bafy...",
  "modelVersion":"resnet50-v1.3",
  "attestationSignature": "0xabc...",
  "timestamp":"2025-06-12T10:12:00Z"
}
```

**3) Safe transaction create** (backend uses Safe Transaction Service)
`POST /safe/{safeAddress}/transactions` — payload uses Gnosis Safe API to create a transaction object that signers will approve. ([Safe Docs][3])

---

## 14 — Security & audit checklist

* HSM + multi-sig key custody for treasury owners. ([Safe Docs][3])
* Smart contract audits (min. 2 reputable firms) and CI/CD gating for on-chain deployments.
* Rate limit SMS webhooks and require OTP for first-time voters.
* Encrypt images before IPFS upload when they contain PII; store only hashed references on-chain. ([docs.filecoin.io][13])
* Oracle decentralization: require 2+ oracle attestations for automatic payout; else fall back to human review.

---

## 15 — Testing & validation plan

* **Unit & integration tests** for all backend APIs and Safe interactions.
* **AI validation**: holdout test set + on-the-ground spot checks. Require pilot accuracy threshold (≥95% precision) before fully automated payouts.
* **Chaos tests** for oracle downtime and telco outages (simulate delayed attestations & stalled payouts).
* **Privacy & compliance tests**: PII leakage scan and encryption validation.

---

## 16 — Team (initial)

* Product Lead / PM — 1
* Backend Engineers — 2–3
* Blockchain / Smart Contract Engineer — 1–2 (Gnosis Safe & oracle integrator)
* ML Engineer(s) — 2 (CV + model infra)
* DevOps / SRE — 1
* Field Ops / Community Manager(s) — 2 per region
* Security / Compliance — 1 (external counsel as needed)
* UX Designer (mobile/SMS flows) — 1

---

## 17 — Risks & mitigations

* **Model errors (FP/FN)** → conservative thresholds, human-in-loop fallback, and phased automation.
* **Oracle compromise** → require multiple independent attestations (DON) and signed evidence. ([Chainlink Blog][8])
* **SMS spam / SIM spoofing** → OTP or secondary verification; require two-factor validation for critical payouts.
* **Regulatory / legal pushback** → engage local regulators early and limit pilot to low-dollar disbursements until legal clarity.
* **Telco reliability** → support multiple SMS providers and local bulk SMS gateways.

---

## 18 — Ballpark budget (pilot, 9 months)

* Engineering & ML (salaries + contractors): \$180–350k
* Infra & cloud: \$15–30k (data storage, imagery APIs such as Planet) ([Planet][6])
* Audits & legal/regulatory fees: \$30–80k
* Field ops & pilot logistics: \$20–60k
* Oracles / DA / IPFS storage & twilio SMS fees: \$10–40k
  **Pilot total (9 months):** **\$255k – \$560k** (very rough — we’ll refine by country & scale)

---

## 19 — Pilot success & scale plan

Pilot success criteria:

* AI audit accuracy threshold reached on field-checked cases.
* SMS voting adoption ≥ 80% of members.
* No critical security incidents in 9 months.

If successful: scale by onboarding MFIs as distribution partners, integrate microcredit products, add drone imagery for high-value projects, and open marketplace for audited projects.
